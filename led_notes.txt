LED_CIRCUIT_DESIGN_SPEC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, we started by picking an LED that would be interesting to implement. In 
this case, the LTST-C19HE1WT RGB LED seemed interesting since it was fairly
bright and compact.

Since we wanted to have to be able to do as much as possible with the LED, we
created a parallel array of 3 RGB LEDs that will be controlled by three MOSFET.
[One for R, one for G, one for B]

Since a MOS does not take any current from the input source, a 10k resistor
was used as a pull-down for the gate. To mitigate the effects of production
differences, current-limiting resistors were placed on the cathodes of each
LED's cathodes. The value for this current-limiting resistor was calculated
using the assumption that 1) Vds is very tiny (~0); 2) the forward voltages
were 2.1V, 3.35V, 3.35V for R,G,B LED segments, respectively; 3) the forward
current for each of the LEDs is around 20mA. Values could simply be calculated
through the equation,[3.7-(forward drop)]/.02, and rounded down to the nearest
resistor value available. [We got values of 43, 16, and 16 Ohms for R,G,B, 
respectively, after considering the effects of resistors on the brightness.]

Power could be checked quite quickly in this case. Since the current is known
to be around 20mA, the power for each resistor is calculated using the following:
(.02)(.02)(resistor val) = Power
All of them gave values smaller than 1/8, the maximum power rating for the
resistors.

NOTE: THE RESISTORS ARE OF THE SAME FAMILY AND THEREFORE USE THE SAME DATASHEET.
