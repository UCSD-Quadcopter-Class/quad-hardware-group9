LED_CIRCUIT_DESIGN_SPEC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: The previous design was changed due to a misunderstanding about using the ::
:: light intensity per watt instead of using the typical intensity as lumens ::

Now, the circuit uses three red and three royal blue LEDs. Both of these are
considered high-power LEDs and therefore can be used to create a considerable
amount of light. The datasheet is located in the LEDs folder as `creeinc_...`.

From here, I decided to place them in a MOS circuit to be able to control the
brightness using a PWM pin. Since two LEDs would be running for any NMOS in
saturation, the current draw while one is on would be 350mA. It's true that
current draw would be 700mA max when both are on, but assuming I need both
to be on, I could just flash them in sequence quickly to simulate the effect.

Resistance values were calculated using the general equation (and assuming that
the Vds drop for the saturated MOS would be approx. 0V):

    V_BAT - Vd
    -----------
     .175 mA

where V_BAT is the battery voltage at any given moment (max is the most useful),
and Vd is the drop accross the diode (something slightly higher than typical
was used).

One thing to note is that due to their typical current rating of 175mA, the
resistors we generally use could not be used in this application. To remedy
the problem, I introduced two new 1/2 W resistors so that the power dissipation
would be well under the max power rating.
