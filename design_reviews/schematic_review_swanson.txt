Nice looking schematic!

1 uF filter caps in motor controllers should be 0.1uF

Your custom LEDS are all backwards.

The pulldown on your custom LED driver is probably not necessary.  There's no harm it being high and they are just two more parts to place and solder.

You don't need netbridge U$7.

Your pullup resistors on SDA/SCL are too small.  Use 10kOhm.  At 330, it quite possible that the ucontroller and IMU will not be able to pull them low.

A critical pin on your IMU is not connected.  Read the datasheet about what each pin does.
